# Anno Wiki Tool 纪元维基工具

Anno Wiki Tool is a python script that is used to boost the efficiency on cloning Anno Fandom to Anno Huiji. Technically it can also be used for all the Fandom sites. It currently has the following features:

1. Convert Fandom Templates into Huiji Format(Anno 1800 Building Construction Template Specific)

2. Downloading Pictures from specific sites

3. Downloading Pictures from icon site(Anno 1800 Specific)

Theoretically the second feature could be applied to all Fandom sites as long as they all have the same class attribute and element arrangements. 

### You may find the composed exe file under this branch too and you can directly run it without installing anything.

To run the source code, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- requests

- bs4 (Beautiful Soup)

  You are recommended to install these dependencies with pip, like this:

  ```powershell
  pip install DEPENDENCY_NAME
  ```

### We also welcome friends to join us at [Anno中文维基](https://anno1800.huijiwiki.com/) and help us to clone Fandom contents, translate them, and produce our original contents! Note: This whole project is authorized by Ubisoft Shanghai and you can find this Wiki on their official site: [纪元1800中国大陆官网](https://www.ubisoft.com.cn/anno1800)
